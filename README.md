# Minimal Technical Analysis Library for Python

This package offers a curated list of technical analysis indicators and timeseries calculations implemented in cython. The library is built around `numpy` arrays, and comes with wrappers for `pandas` and `polars` dataframes and series.


> **Warning**
> This project is experimental and the interface can change.
> For a similar project with a mature api you may want to look into

- `mintalib.functions`:
    wrapper functions to compute calculations on series and dataframes, with names like `sma`, `ema`, etc ...
- `mintalib.indicators`
    composable interface to indicators with names like `SMA`, `EMA`, etc ...
- `mintalib.expressions`
    polars expressions library with names like `SMA`, `EMA`, etc ...

## Using Functions

Functions are available as lower case methods like `sma`, `ema`, etc ...
The best way to use this module is to alias it to a short name
like `ta` and access all functions as attributes.

```python
import mintalib.functions as ta
```

The first parameter of a function is either `prices` or `series` depending on whether
the functions expects a dataframe of prices or a single series.

Functions that expect series data can also be applied to a prices dataframe, in which case they use the column specified with the `item` parameter or by default the 'close' column.

A `prices` dataframe can be a pandas or polars dataframe. The column names for prices are expected to include `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, `volume` all in **lower case**.

A `series` can be a pandas or polars series.

Functions automatically wrap the result to match the type and the index of the input data when applicable.


```python
import yfinance as yf
import mintalib.functions as ta

# fetch prices (eg with yfinance)
prices = yf.Ticker('AAPL').history('5y')

# convert column and index names to lower case
prices = prices.rename(columns=str.lower).rename_axis(index=str.lower)

# compute indicators
sma50 = ta.sma(prices, 50)  # SMA of 'close' with period 50
sma200 = ta.sma(prices, 200)  # SMA of 'close' with period 200
high200 = ta.max(prices, 200, item='high')  # MAX of 'high' with period 200
```


## Using Indicators

Indicators are available via the `indicators` module, with similar names as functions but in **upper case**. Indicators are best imported directly in the name space like:

```python
from mintalib.indicators import SMA, EMA, ROC, MACD
```

Indicators offer a composable interface where a function is bound with its calculation parameters. When instantiated with parameters an indicator yields a callable that can be applied to prices or series data.

An indicator is a callable that accepts a series or a prices dataframe as a single parameter. You can also use the `@` operator as syntactic sugar to apply an indicator to its parameter. 

So for example `SMA(50) @ prices` can be used to compute the 50 period simple moving average on `prices`, instead of the more verbose `SMA(50)(prices)`. 

```python
sma50 = SMA(50) @ prices    # SMA of 'close' with period 50
sma200 = SMA(200) @ prices  # SMA of 'close' with period 200
high200 = MAX(200, item='high') @ prices    # MAX of 'high' with period 200
```

The `@` operator can also be used to chain indicators, where for example `ROC(1) @ EMA(20)` means `ROC(1)` applied to `EMA(20)`.

```python
trend = ROC(1) @ EMA(20) @ prices
```

## Using Indicators with pandas

With pandas dataframes you can compose and apply multiple indicators in one call using the `assign` dataframe method.

```python
import yfinance as yf

from mintalib.indicators import EMA, SMA, ROC, RSI, EVAL

# fetch prices (eg with yfinance)
prices = yf.Ticker('AAPL').history('5y')

# convert column and index names to lower case
prices = prices.rename(columns=str.lower).rename_axis(index=str.lower)

# compute and append indicators to prices
# note that calculations can use results from prior indicators
result = prices.assign(
    sma50 = SMA(50),
    sma200 = SMA(200),
    rsi = RSI(14),
    trend = ROC(1) @ EMA(20),
    flag = EVAL("sma50 > sma200")
)
```

## Using Expressions with polars (experimental)

Expressions are available via the `expressions` module, with similar names as functions but in **upper case**. Expressions are best imported directly in the name space like:

```python
from mintalib.expressions import SMA, EMA, ROC, MACD, ATR
```

Series based expressions have a first argument `src` that is required. The `src` parameter can be a column name or a polars expression. So for example `SMA('close', period=50)`, is equivalent to `SMA(pl.col('close'), period=50)`.

```python
prices.select(
    SMA('close', period=50)
)
```

Series expressions can also be applied with the polars `pipe` method as in:

```python
prices.select(
    pl.col('close').pipe(SMA, period=50)
)
```

In prices based expressions like `ATR`, the `src` argument is optional and keyword only. 

```python
prices.select(
    ATR(period=14)
)
```

Multi-column expressions like `MACD` return a struct series instead of a dataframe. You can access the fields with the polars `struct` accessor. So for example to convert he `MACD` expression to individual columns you can use the following:

```python
prices.select(
    MACD('close').struct.field('*')
)
```
