# Minimal Technical Analysis Library for Python

This package offers a curated list of technical analysis indicators implemented in cython yo offer improved performance.
It is built around `numpy` arrays and aims to be compatible with `pandas` and also `polars` where applicable.
The library is pre-compiled with `cython` so as not to require the `cython` runtime at installation.
Also it does not link with `numpy` and should avoid binary dependency issues.


> **Warning**
> This project is experimental and the interface can change.
> For a similar project with a mature api you may want to look into
> [ta-lib](https://pypi.org/project/TA-Lib/).

## Mintalib Core

The calculation routines in `mintalib.core`, implemented in cython, operate on numpy arrays and return numpy arrays by default.
Functions in `mintalib.functions` and indicators in `mintalib.indicatoers` are just wrappers around the core calculation routines.


## Using Functions

Functions are available via the `functions` module,
with names like `sma`, `ema`, `rsi`, `macd`, all in **lower case**.
The first parameter of a function is either `prices` or `series` depending on whether
the functions expects a dataframe of prices or a single series.
Functions that expect series data can be applied to a prices dataframe, in which case they use 
the column specified with the `item` parameter or by default the 'close' column.

A `prices` dataframe can be a pandas dataframe, a polars dataframe or a dictionary of numpy arrays.
The column names for prices are expected to include `open`, `high`, `low`, `close`, `volume` all in **lower case**.
A `series` can be a pandas series, a polars series or any iterable compatible with numpy arrays.

Functions automatically wrap their result to match their input, so that for example 
pandas based inputs will yield pandas based results with a matching index.


```python
import yfinance as yf
import mintalib.functions as ta

# fetch prices (eg with yfinance)
prices = yf.Ticker('AAPL').history('5y')

# convert column and index names to lower case
prices = prices.rename(columns=str.lower).rename_axis(index=str.lower)

# compute indicators
sma50 = ta.sma(prices, 50)  # SMA of 'close' with period 50
sma200 = ta.sma(prices, 200)  # SMA of 'close' with period 200
high200 = ta.max(prices, 200, item='high')  # MAX of 'high' with period 200
```


## Using Indicators

Indicators are available via the `indicators` module, with similar names as functions but in **uper case**.

Indicators offer a composable interface where a function is bound with its calculation parameters. When instantiated with parameters an indicator yields a callable that can be applied to prices or series data. Indicators support the `@` operator as syntactic sugar to apply the indicator to data. So for example `SMA(50) @ prices` can be used to compute the 50 period simple moving average on `prices`, insted of `SMA(50)(prices)`.

```python
from mintalib.indicators import ROC. SMA, EMA

sma50 = SMA(50) @ prices
sma200 = SMA(200) @ prices
```

The `@` operator can also be used to compose indicators, where for example `ROC(1) @ EMA(20)` means `ROC(1)` applied to `EMA(20)`.

```python
trend = ROC(1) @ EMA(20) @ prices
```


## Using Indicators with Pandas

Prices indicators like `ATR` can only be applied to prices dataframes.

```python
atr = ATR(14) @ prices
```

Series indicators can be applied to a prices dataframe or a series. When applied to prices you must specify a column with the `item` or otherwize the indicator will use the `'close'` column by default.

```python
# SMA on the close column
sma50 = SMA(50) @ prices

# SMA on the volume column
vol50 = SMA(50, item='volume') @ prices

# Which is the same as
vol50 = SMA(50) @ prices.volume 
``` 

With pandas dataframes you can compose and assign multiple indicators in one call using the builtin `assign` method.


```python
import yfinance as yf

from mintalib.indicators import EMA, SMA, ROC, RSI, EVAL

# fetch prices (eg with yfinance)
prices = yf.Ticker('AAPL').history('5y')

# convert column and index names to lower case
prices = prices.rename(columns=str.lower).rename_axis(index=str.lower)

# compute and append indicators to prices
# note that calculations can use results from prior indicators
result = prices.assign(
    sma50 = SMA(50),
    sma200 = SMA(200),
    rsi = RSI(14),
    trend = ROC(1) @ EMA(20),
    flag = EVAL("sma50 > sma200")
)
```


## Using Indicators with Polars

Indicators can be applied to polars prices dataframes and series in the same way as with pandas. 

The `@` operator has been extended to work with polars expressions. Series indicators should be applied to a `polars.col` object, while 
prices indicators should be applied to the `polars.all()` expression. In the expression context, multi column outputs are returned as struct series.

In the following example, you can assign multiple columns using polars `with_columns`.

```python
import polars as pl

import yfinance as yf

from mintalib.indicators import SMA, ATR

# fetch prices (eg with yfinance)
prices = yf.Ticker('AAPL').history('5y')

# convert column and index names to lower case
prices = prices.rename(columns=str.lower).rename_axis(index=str.lower)

# convert to polars dataframe 
prices = pl.from_pandas(prices, include_index=True)

# compute and append indicators to prices
result = prices.with_columns(
    sma20 = SMA(20) @ pl.col('close'),
    sma50 = SMA(50) @ pl.col('close'),
    atr14 = ATR(14) @ pl.all()
)
```
